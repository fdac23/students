Hello, my name is Elijah Berberette, and I am a first-year Master's student pursuing computer science with a focus in Intelligent Systems and Machine Learning. I am super interested in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, RL, and anything within this field. I would like to focus on a project that uses deep learning to tackle a problem related to AI-code production or Image Classification. In the past I have produced neural networks that could differentiate AI-written code from Human-written code and predict latitude and longititude coordinates based on a concatenation of three images scraped from Geoguesser. I am open to ideas,  In the past I have produced neural networks that could differentiate AI-written code from Human-written code and predict latitude and longititude coordinates based on a concatenation of three images scraped from Geoguesser. I am open to ideas, and would love to learn more about new topics from others.
