My name is Zack Malkmus and I am a junior pursuing a bachelors in computer science. I currently work for Jewelry Television in Knoxville doing web development and love playing games and solving puzzles that challenge my brain to grow. I'm not sure exactly what career path in computer science I want to take, but I know I love coding and coming up with creative ways to solve problems. I know that somewhere along the variety of topics coding can solve I will find what I want to do.
