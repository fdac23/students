My name is Imani Pelton and I am a graduate student pursuing his MS in Computer Science with a minor in Cybersecurity. I work in the EECS IT office right now as a graduate assistant. I am a Chattanooga native and love the East Tennessee area. I love trying restaurants, I've been to more concerts than I could count, and recently I've made it a personal goal to see as many of the National Parks as I can (6 so far!). My favorite coding language is Rust, and I hope to eventually translate my skills with the language into a job in software development.
