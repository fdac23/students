I'm Tyler Nitzsche, a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in chinese. My primary focus is on machine learning so I wanted to take this course to help
with the data management side of that. My current experience in machine learning is in creating a NLP based research assistant which could read research paper abstracts
and make predictions if they were in a specified category within the Arxiv tags and also predict whether the user would be interested in the paper based on their past
papers which they have marked as interested. Beyond my academic interests I tend to find interest in pretty much anything that might fall under the category of "Nerdy", 
video games, card games, board games, books, shows, movies, whatever, if it's nerdy I've probably at least heard of it.
